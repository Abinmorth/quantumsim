# quantumsim
I was planning to make a quantum calculator app, something like being able to manipulate the calculation-tree. I'm not sure how to proceed with this project, but it has already a working GUI for creating circuits (select a gate, then click on a line to add). Maybe someone finds a use for it in their own  projects.
the project uses p5.js and math.js
